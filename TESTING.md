### Handheld devices responsiveness

|Page|Smartphone|Tablet horizontal|Tablet vertical|
|:---|:--------:|:---------------:|:-------------:|
|**INDEX:**<BR><BR>The layout of the Homepage is responsive as expected from the wireframes.<br> - The hero image is cropped as expected to adjust to the viewport of the device.<br>-The layout of the Mosaic in vertical tablet has been tested exceptionally as of Surface 7 pro in the DevTools.<br> - The Mosaic adapts in four different breakpoints, as of the BootStrap grid set up. <br> - The stack menu button in the smallest viewport works as expected.<br>- The footer, also with BootStrap grid, is also responsive as expected<br> stacking the content in column.|![rm_index_on_iphone_se1](assets/images/rm_index_on_iphone_se1.png)<br>![rm_index_on_iphone_se2](assets/images/rm_index_on_iphone_se2.png)<br>![rm_index_on_iphone_se3](assets/images/rm_index_on_iphone_se3.png)<br><br>|![rm_int_ipad_hor_index](assets/images/rm_int_ipad_hor_index.jpg)<br>![rm_int_ipad_hor_index_mosaic](assets/images/rm_int_ipad_hor_index_mosaic.jpg)|!![rm_int_ipad_ver_index](assets/images/rm_int_ipad_ver_index.jpg)<br>![rm_int_surfacepro7_ver_index_mosaic](assets/images/rm_int_surfacepro7_ver_index_mosaic.png)|
|**INVESTORS:**<BR><BR>The main interactive feature of the page is the cal.com appointment booking feature. <br>The responsiveness of the feature has been set app by the developers of the widget at the <br>commercial provider. However, it reacts satisfyingly with all expected breakpoints of the page.|![rm_investors_on_iphone_se1](assets/images/rm_investors_on_iphone_se1.png)<br>![rm_investors_on_iphone_se2](assets/images/rm_investors_on_iphone_se2.png)|![rm_int_ipad_hor_investors](assets/images/rm_int_ipad_hor_investors.jpg)|![rm_int_ipad_ver_investors](assets/images/rm_int_ipad_ver_investors.jpg)|
|**Crowdfunding:**<br><br>The page currently only contains one interactive feature:<br> The "Buy me a coffee" widget. The widget is quite whimsical, <br>since the commercial promoter has designed it to stick to the <br>bottom-right corner of the viewport. To have it feature prominently <br>under the text which refers to it, setting up an iframe containing an <br>ancillary page - featuring the widget - was necessary. <br>The setup of the feature in different breakpoints has been the main complication of coding the page.|![rm_crowdfunding_on_iphone_se_bmc](assets/images/rm_crowdfunding_on_iphone_se_bmc.png)|![rm_int_ipad_hor_crowdfunding](assets/images/rm_int_ipad_hor_crowdfunding.jpg)|![rm_int_ipad_ver_crowdfunding](assets/images/rm_int_ipad_ver_crowdfunding.jpg)|
