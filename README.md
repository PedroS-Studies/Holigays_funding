Sandbox project for hotel as destination OTA 

# Table of Content

## User Experience
### Strategy
This project is developped as a Sandbox for a general OTA (Online Travel Agency) project for Hotel-as-destination with unlimited number of niches.
### Scope
This first module of the sandbox is the fundraising website of Holigays Central. It is promoted under the umbrella of Arlesiana Ltd, which promotes long-tail marketing projects in hospitality. 
The users of the website are expected to be 
- Investors
- Interested partners
- Prospective individual customers
- Hoteliers, existing or prospective, interested either in the concept of LGBTQIA+ hotel or an OTA pandering these services.

The Investors and possible Partners are targeted as one group with unified users. They will be offered an immediate access to appointment in exchange of their information including professional validation details.

The prospective customers will be offered three levels of involvment:
- Registration of interest (Newsletter)
- Show of sympathy - "buy me a coffee", still a show of interest.
- Possibility to crowdfund the project
As of today, this is mainly to measure the interest of the possible customerbase in the product.

The Gay hoteliers, existing or prospective aren't currently targeted by the project. The situation nowadays, with destination-first mentality, is that even co-called gay-destinations have so few exclusively LGBTQIA+ structures that the owners have all the interest in bringing the guests to their own website and avoiding to have to pay commissions to OTA's.

However, the current trend is toward guests booking the "hotel as detination". This will not only promote the specific search engines telling the customers where to find a hotel for "rainbow family", "Gaymers" or "Gay golfers", being the destinations riding the segment of LGBTQIA+  increasingly attractive for tourism. The Niche-specificity will be a defining factor.

The sub-niches of "LGBTQIA+" category are sufficiently limited, labelled and controlled as branding to serve as sandbox for a wider Niche-related OTA project, with more complex features in the management of an unlimited and ever-increasing roster of niches. 

Currently, the mainstream OTA's, such as booking.com or hotels.com provide at the best the category of "Gay-friendly".

Ideally the project developped in this sandbox will eventually become part of this wider Niche-related, Hotel-as-destination OTA, or should it have success as independent interface, it could still profit from the engine of the wider project as SaaS.
